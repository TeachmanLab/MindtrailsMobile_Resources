Remember, avoiding or leaving the situation might feel better in the moment, but actually makes anxiety worse in the future! Try to think about behaviors that you can do in the moment that would allow you to stay in the situation. What could you do in the situation that allows you to push through anxiety? \n\nPlease take 60 seconds to write as many behaviors that you could do in the moment that would be helpful and make you feel less anxious in the future."
