Were you able to imagine yourself in the different situations?</p><br><p><b>P2: That was tricky at first but then I tried to really slow down and use my senses - thinking about what I would see and hear and feel if the story ended in the way it did once I filled in the missing letters. It was new for me because I usually think more negatively than the actual story endings. It was interesting to think about different ways that situations can turn out.</b></p><br><p>P1: Great! Our program is meant to help you practice new ways of thinking, to approach situations with more flexibility and less catastrophic thinking. What are some questions that you had while using our app or thinking about each situation?</p><br><p><b>P2: Why are there some negative endings to the stories?</b></p><br><p>P1: The goal of showing different types of stories and endings is to teach you how to think flexibly, and consider multiple outcomes. We know that things don't end positively 100 percent of the time. We also know that some of the endings might feel kind of extreme to you, being more positive or more negative than you’d expect, or not feel realistic to you in some other way. That’s OK, you can think of those as bigger challenges to imagine endings that are very different than how you typically think. We want you to practice thinking about situations in many different ways. As you continue with the app, you will eventually be able to fill-in-the-blank with your own ending to make sure the endings fit the kinds of experiences that matter to you. Our goal is just to get you thinking about different ways to look at situations.</p><br><p><b>P2: Sometimes I felt like the scenarios were repetitive, was there a reason for that?</b></p><br><p>P1: You’re definitely not alone in feeling this way, but there is a reason behind it. Changing your thinking takes time and practice, so while it feels like you’re doing the same thing over and over, you’re building a new way of thinking. You can think of it as building a new muscle - you need to repeat the exercises to make that muscle strong so you can use it in your daily life. We’re building a new thinking muscle and it will take some repetition to make it strong.</p><br><p><b>P2: Why does the text appear slowly, versus all at once?</b></p><br><p>P1: The text is appearing at the average rate of reading to help further immerse you into the story, almost as if you are watching the story unfold. Using your imagination fully takes time but the more you can vividly imagine the story, the more effective the training is likely to be.</p><br><p><b>P2: I’m finding that some of the stories and scenarios aren’t relevant to my current life situation. Can this program still help me?</b></p><br><p>P1: Actually, it can! As you use the app, we will ask you about your personal stressors, and give you more tailored stories. However, we also want you to learn how to apply flexible thinking to lots of stressful situations so that you can then apply that skill to any stressful situation that might come up for you one day.</p><br><p>P1: Now you try it out -- our goal is to apply new ways of thinking in your daily life!</p>"
