You'll first be asked to complete some surveys about your mental health and thinking patterns. Then, we'll give you some more information about the rationale for this program and explain how to get the most out of the app. You'll have the opportunity to set up a meeting with the research team at the end of this session if you have any questions or concerns. Ready to get started? Hit the Next button below to begin filling out questionnaires."

When you complete sessions in the app, you will be asked to read brief stories about situations that often produce anxiety and fill in missing letters to complete words, fill in entire words, or come up with new stories that are personally relevant to you. To help familiarize you with the program and help you get the most out of this experience, we would like you complete a few short exercises and watch some brief videos explaining how Hoos Think Calmly works. You will also be presented with three example stories so that you can begin to get the hang of the training. Click next to get started!"
