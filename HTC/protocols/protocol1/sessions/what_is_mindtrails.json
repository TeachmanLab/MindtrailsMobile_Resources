You jump to the worst-case scenario, thinking: All of the people behind me are going to be so angry. What if this means I have no money in my account?</p><br><p>Why do you have those thoughts?</p><br><p>People with anxiety have rigid, negative patterns of thinking which can make them interpret uncertain situations as threatening. This is where Hoos Think Calmly comes in!</p><br><p>Hoos Think Calmly is a program that can help you deal with high levels of stress and anxiety by developing your flexible thinking skills.</p><br><p>Throughout the program, you will be exposed to ambiguous situations, like the coffee shop example, and practice responding to them in different ways.</p><br><p>The situations will have a mix of positive, neutral, and negative endings. As you practice, you will see that there are many different ways a situation can be interpreted, and the worst-case scenario is only one of them.</p><br><p>These sessions will include reading short stories, some of which may not seem directly relevant to you. That’s OK, it is important that you vividly imagine yourself in the story being described, so you can practice thinking flexibly in lots of situations and then apply the new thinking skills to your own life.</p><br><p>Also, you may feel as though the program is repetitive. That’s to be expected because you need to repeatedly practice the new thinking skills. Changing our thinking habits takes time, so be patient and stick with it!</p><br><p>The science behind Hoos Think Calmly is based on the MindTrails project, an online anxiety program used by thousands of people in more than 65 countries all over the world. Research shows that programs like MindTrails may change rigid negative thinking and reduce anxiety.</p><br><p>As you begin Hoos Think Calmly, we encourage you to think about what you hope to gain from the program. There are no wrong answers. How could your life be better if you reduced your anxious thinking? We hope Hoos Think Calmly can help you meet your goals!.</p>"
