Were you able to fully imagine yourself in the different situations?</p><br><p><strong>Participant:</strong> That was tricky at first but then I tried to really slow down and use my senses - thinking about what I would see and hear and feel if the story ended in the way it did once I filled in the missing letters. It was new for me because I was often expecting the stories to end worse than they actually did. It was interesting to think about different ways that situations can turn out.</p><br><p><strong>:</strong> Great! Our program is meant to help you practice new ways of thinking, to approach situations with more flexibility and less catastrophic thinking. What are some questions that you had while using our app or thinking about each situation?</p><br><p><strong>Participant:</strong> Why does the text appear slowly, versus all at once?</p><br><p><strong>Study Team Member:</strong> The text is appearing at the average rate of reading to help further immerse you into the story, almost as if you are watching the story unfold. Using your imagination fully takes time but the more you can vividly imagine the story, the more effective the training is likely to be.</p><br><p><strong>Participant:</strong> Why do I need to read all the different stories if I’m only worried about one thing?</p><br><p><strong>Study Team Member:</strong> Actually, we will ask you about your personal stressors, and give you more tailored stories. However, we also want you to learn how to apply flexible thinking to lots of stressful situations so that you can then apply that skill to the broad range of stressful situations that might come up for you.</p><br><p><strong>Participant:</strong> Why are there some negative endings to the stories?</p><br><p><strong>Study Team Member:</strong> The goal of showing different types of stories and endings is to teach you how to think flexibly, and consider multiple outcomes. We know that things don't end positively 100 percent of the time.</p><br><p><strong>Study Team Member:</strong> What was it like to think in this new way? How would your life be different if you thought like this? Try it out -- our goal is to apply new ways of thinking in your daily life.</p>"
